Genre: Not sure what the genre is but is a mix between galaga
and asteroid where you try to survive an alien attack

Challenge: Try to last as long as possible as you try to survive
swarms of aliens.  If you can avoid their attacks, you may just 
survive another day in the final frontier.

You win the game by living long enough.  Getting struck by an enemy
will damage your ship but you do have a shield to help.  

Control your ship using wasd keys.  There will be cheat codes for health
regen, different flight control and potentially a game breaking 
invincibility mode.

Alien swarms will vary.  The first one is simple, just a bunch of aliens 
moving randomly in space not targeting the ship however as time progresses
aliens ay change strategies by directly approaching your ship or appearing 
out of thin air.  So far just the first one is done.
