First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016

Started on 8/29/16
Finished on 9/09/16 but I spent an hour on 9/11/16 making my code more readable

Time Spent: 24 hours

Resources Used: youtube.com and stack exchange

Files to start/test: Main

Files needed: Anything in src will be needed.  I imported images from there so please import the entire src

Info:
Control character using typical WASD controls (w is up, a is left, s is down, d is right).  Shoot is space.  There are 4 cheat codes.  The first is speed control.  I initially had speed controls be similar to original galaga but I wanted to make the game more interesting by pretending the ship was in space.  This means that normally movement is very fast and harder to control because your ship will keep moving.  The other cheat key for this resets the controls back to the space controls.  The next cheat makes you invincible to enemies.  Simply put, you will not die.  The final cheat code allows you to skip the asteroid field and go straight to the boss fight.  
Cheat key List:

1. J -> standard controls
2. K -> space controls (default)
3. L -> godmode, you can't die
4. O -> skip to boss level

Bugs: Sometimes player can't shoot in a rendition a week ago but I think I squashed that bug. Player shots can damage its own ship if the ship is moving.  This is not common but it does occur. 

All in all, I really enjoyed this assignment.  Wasn't too challenging and was rather fun.  I wish we were given a better example in order to make learning javafx easier.
